# Road Safety Analysis and Prediction Model

## Overview

As a dedicated data scientist tasked with advising government agencies on road safety improvements, the objective is to analyze the provided dataset and construct a robust prediction model for road traffic accidents and the associated injuries. This document outlines the essential questions addressed in this analysis and the methodologies employed.

## Analysis Questions

1. **Accident Timing Analysis:**
   - Identify significant hours of the day and days of the week when accidents occur.
   - Specifically focus on motorbike accidents, distinguishing between Motorcycle 125cc and under, Motorcycle over 125cc and up to 500cc, and Motorcycle over 500cc.
   - Investigate significant hours and days for pedestrian-involved accidents.

2. **Impact of Selected Variables on Accident Severity:**
   - Utilize the apriori algorithm to explore the influence of selected variables on accident severity.

3. **Regional Accident Clustering:**
   - Identify accidents in the specified region (Kingston upon Hull, Humberside, and the East Riding of Yorkshire) using various filters (LSOA, police region, etc.).
   - Implement clustering techniques to reveal patterns and distributions of accidents in the region.

4. **Outlier Detection:**
   - Apply outlier detection methods to identify unusual entries in the dataset.
   - Consider the necessity of retaining these entries in the analysis.

5. **Classification Model for Fatal Injuries:**
   - Develop a classification model using the provided data to predict fatal injuries in road traffic accidents.
   - Aim to provide insights that inform and enhance road safety measures.

## Methodologies

- **Accident Timing Analysis:**
  - Utilize time series analysis to identify patterns in accident occurrences over hours and days of the week.
  - Employ subgroup analysis for motorbike and pedestrian-related accidents.

- **Impact of Selected Variables on Accident Severity:**
  - Implement the apriori algorithm for association rule mining, considering variables that may impact accident severity.

- **Regional Accident Clustering:**
  - Employ clustering algorithms such as K-means or DBSCAN to identify spatial patterns in accidents within the specified region.

- **Outlier Detection:**
  - Apply statistical methods or machine learning algorithms for detecting outliers.
  - Assess the relevance of outliers to the overall analysis.

- **Classification Model for Fatal Injuries:**
  - Utilize a supervised machine learning approach.
  - Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
